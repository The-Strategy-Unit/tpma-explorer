The majority of the data underpinning this app is a by-product of the modelling process for the New Hospital Programme (NHP).

The primary data source is [Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-tools-and-services/data-services/hospital-episode-statistics).
Data is suppressed in visualisations where counts are less thatn five.

More information is available on [the NHP model project information website](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/).
That includes detail on [age-sex standardisation](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/modelling_methodology/activity_mitigators/direct_standardisation_of_tpmas.html) of TPMAs and how we [derive hospital catchments](https://connect.strategyunitwm.nhs.uk/nhp/project_information/data_extraction/deriving_hospital_catchments.html) for rate calculations.

You can find the Python source code in [the inputs_data scripts](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data/tree/main/src/nhp/data/inputs_data) of [the open nhp_data GitHub repository](https://github.com/The-Strategy-Unit/nhp_data).
