Subject matter experts were invited to provide forecasts about future hospital activity (2039/40) using an [evidence-based elicitation exercise](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2024-084632).
Experts were asked for the expected level of activity for TPMAs following mitigation, expressed as as an 80% prediction interval.
The aggregated results can provide a useful 'outside' view but should not be interpreted as an expectation of what can be achieved locally.
